## Design Stages
1. Requirement Analysis
    - understanding and finding out the requirement
    - why do they need the system,
    - how the data needs to be stored
    -  how will the data and system be used
    - <b>identify entities</b>
    - meet stake holders and users
    - determine what operations are needed (report, forms, queries) etc

2. Conceptual Design
    - create erd, eerd diagrams for the system
    - conduct composition / decomposition
    - identify entity, attributes, relationship
3. Logical Design
    - convert the diagram into a logical scheme
    - define the structure of the database
    - find entities, attributes, data types, primary and foreign keys, constraints
    - conduct <b>normalization</b>
4. Physical Design
    - how the data will be store into the
    - which dbms system to use
5. Implementation
    - build the database based on the logical and physical design
    - use sql
    - create tables, constraint, keys
    - procedures, triggers, views
    - load initial data
6. Testing and Evaluation
    -ensure requirements are met and the database performs how it is supposed to, no major bug,
    - test CRUD functionality
    - performance testing
    - security testing
7. Deployment
    - deploy the database, ready for official use
    - set user roles and permissions
    - final configurations
8. Maintenance and Monitoring
    - ensure that database runs properly overtime
    - backups
    - tuning and scaling
    - audit
    - logging
